## About The Project

A URL shortener is a web tool that simplifies long and complex URLs into shorter, more manageable links. It works by taking a lengthy URL and creating a redirect that points to the original address. These shortened URLs are commonly used in social media platforms, where character limits are imposed, or when sharing links that need to be concise and user-friendly. Besides compactness, URL shorteners often provide additional features such as tracking click-through rates and analyzing user engagement. They offer convenience, allowing users to share links easily while maintaining the integrity and functionality of the original URL. Whether for personal use or professional marketing campaigns, URL shorteners have become an essential tool in the digital landscape, enhancing accessibility and enhancing the overall user experience
